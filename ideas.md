# Design Brainstorming for Mehak Garg's Portfolio

## Goal
Create a super cool personal website showcasing Mehak Garg's experience as an AI Product Builder and Agentic Systems Designer.

## Updated Approach: Galactic Space Theme

**Design Movement:** Cosmic Futurism

**Core Principles:**
- Deep space aesthetics with nebula-inspired gradients
- Luminous, ethereal quality suggesting infinite possibility
- Sophisticated dark palette with glowing accents
- Sense of exploration and discovery

**Color Philosophy:**
Deep cosmic blacks (#0a0e27, #1a1f3a) as the foundation, with vibrant nebula colors—electric blue (#4f46e5), cosmic purple (#8b5cf6), stellar pink (#ec4899), and celestial cyan (#06b6d4). These colors represent the vast potential of AI systems and the exploratory nature of building agentic workflows. Glowing accents suggest intelligence and consciousness.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Floating content islands in space with generous negative space suggesting the cosmos. Subtle parallax effects create depth. Content appears to float against the starfield background. Smooth scrolling with fade transitions.

**Signature Elements:**
- Animated starfield background with twinkling stars
- Glowing borders and subtle neon effects
- Gradient text with cosmic colors
- Soft glows and halos around interactive elements
- Particle effects suggesting stardust

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Smooth, weightless interactions as if navigating through space. Hover states trigger gentle glows and color shifts. Elements respond with floating animations. The interface feels expansive and exploratory.

**Animation:**
Smooth, flowing transitions (0.6-0.9s) with gentle easing. Floating animations on scroll. Glow effects that pulse subtly. Stars twinkle in the background. Elements fade in with upward drift.

**Typography System:**
- Display: Space Grotesk Bold (56-96px) for modern, tech-forward headers
- Body: Inter Regular (16-18px) for clean readability
- Accent: Orbitron for tech/sci-fi emphasis
- Light text on dark backgrounds with glowing effects

**Simplified Structure:**
- Homepage: Hero section + About section only
- All other content (experience, projects, skills, education, contact) moved to separate pages or removed from immediate view
